"""
Creates folded 3-dimensional gridded geometries efficiently from planar cells and fold lines.

Inputs:
    grid_cells: List of Curves (list access, closed crv)
    fold_lines: DataTree of Curves (tree access, open crv)
    fold_angle: Number (item access, float)
    solid: Boolean (item access, bool)

Outputs:
    folded_cells: List of Breps (The final 3D folded geometries)
