# Geometry Boundary 2D

## Objective

create a python script which draws a boundary rectangle around a geometry based on the user defined plane.

## Inputs

- geo
- plane: user defines the plane on which the rectangle will be drawn

## Outputs

- bounding rectangle
- x: dimension in first axis of plane
- y: dimension in second axis of plane (essentially a length and width, but universal to any plane the user inputs)

## Note

Below is a standard codeblock which should be placed above all created scripts. the information contained within it should reflect the script's contents. The code below should serve as a standard/example only.

Adhere strictly to written standards like spacing, capitalization, etc. 

Adhere strictly to naming conventions for the component, the component nickname, input naming, and output naming.

Adhere stricly to the standard for commenting information about the script's inputs/outputs and their input details so I can configure the component easily.
